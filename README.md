# Rename Placeholders In All Subfolders

The user is asked to enter values that will replace placeholders such as [rd], [bacteria], [name], [type], [date]

The script uses a folder named "Notebook Template_SCRIPT_USES_THIS_FOLDER" (should be located in the same folder as the script)
and renames all the placeholders in the file names with the entered values. 


A new folder will be created inside 'Created Notebooks'. The name of the new folder will be a combination of [rd], [name], [date]
